<h3><b>Description</b> </h3>
<p>This photo of 17 narrow locks in <span style="color:#67a1a3;font-weight:bold"> Stoke Bruerne</span>. Stoke Bruerne is mentioned in the doomsday Book in 1086 as "Stoche" meaning "an outlying farmstead or
    hamlet". The form <i>"Stokbruer"</i> is used in 1254 being a suffix by the "Briwere" family of the Manor House. The village is fairly typical for this area of south
    Northamptonshire containing many traditional stone and thatched cottages. The village's main claim to fame is its situation on the Grand Union Canal
    making it a favourite desination for tourists. The population is split 196 male and 199 female in 169 households (2001 census). Stoke Bruerne is also a home
    to <span style="color:#67a1a3;font-weight:bold"> The canal Museum, Stoke Bruerne</span>. This photo was taken on October 13, 2020.
