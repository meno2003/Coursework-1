            <p> <h3> Winter Wonderland</h3>
             Working in Winter Wonderland has taught me a lot about communication and teamwork, working long and strenuous 12 hour shifts 5 to 6 days
             a week but due to my natural ability to make the best out of it. Enjoying myself maybe a little <sup>too</sup> much , meeting new people, putting smile on peoples
             faces everyday was truly a gift, and to get paid for it was nice too. the people ive met along the journey at Winter Wonderland aswell
             made it all worth it. <br>
             <br>

             <h3> Costa Coffee</h3>
             <br>
             Dealing with massive hoardes of customers, naturally ive had to pick up the art of time management making sure the place is clean, the stations are filled, the stock is in check, the food is in good condition
             , and a variety of other things, all whilst making sure to make the perfect coffee, something that took me quite a while to learn but none the less, im proud to say ive mastered the art of coffee making, capable of making
             incredibly articulate drawings on the flat white making customers stunned to even take a sip to destroy the delicate creamy texture on top of the flat white.
             but also once again, its taught me team work. such a valuable asset in a coffee shop to ensure smooth sailing.

            <h2> Education </h2>
             <h4><abbr title="International School of Martyrs"> ISM</abbr> High school</h4>
             <p> Studied high school in this establishment leading the football team into two consecutive tournament wins in a row during 10th and 11th grade
                whilst also hosting a bake sale to raise funds for a refugee charity during the war outbreak in the city
             </p>
             <h4> City University of London</h4>
             <p>  during only my foundation year, enrolled in the student rep programme leaving no student unheard whilst also making sure we as a class are kept at the top of our potential
            , Ive also enrolled in robotics society and computer science society making sure to network with like minded people especcially those in the years ahead of me so I can pick up important details regarding the years to come in the Tech industry
             </p>
             <h4> Chiswick school</h4>
             <p> Had a short stint of two years in Chiswick secondary school for about two years in which I developed my people person skills with the other english students, something that was alien to me at the time.
                Ive also made life long friends whilst first discovering my passion for computer technology through a friend who was all inspiring in his achievements of making his own
                pac man and street fighter game. it was Mathew that led me to this path, weve lost contact since, but I thank him for showing me what technology really was about.
